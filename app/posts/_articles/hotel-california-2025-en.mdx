It is another California morning. The sky is that cloudless, almost distorted shade of digital blue. The sunlight, unstinting in its generosity, floods the entire valley, piercing the windshield to cast dancing spots of light onto the steering wheel. I am gliding down Highway 101 toward Mountain View, the AC blasted to the max, the beats of Daft Punk filling the cabin. Ahead, Google’s new headquarters, Gradient Canopy, gleams with a futuristic metallic sheen under the daylight.

Everything looks brand new, precise, and perfect.

That is, until I park and walk toward the office entrance, my line of sight intercepted by a row of colorful gBikes. The classic red, yellow, blue, and green color scheme is exactly the same as what I saw when I first set foot on this land ten years ago. In that moment, time suddenly folded in on itself.

My thoughts drift back to that sweltering summer. It was my first time in the United States, and the coordinates were also California. My memory is filled with intense sensory shocks: the ubiquitous, loud, and freezing air conditioning in malls and hotels; the shocking portion sizes of American Chinese food; and the massive cups of McDonald's ice coke that gave you a brain freeze. I still remember staring jaw-dropped at an eighteen-dollar steak, thinking it was outrageously expensive while secretly complaining that it wasn’t even that good. Now, the fact that eighteen dollars can buy me a meal that fills me up with peace of mind feels like something to be thankful for.

It turns out that ten years is nothing more than a change in a price tag, and a freeze-frame of an object’s appearance.

Walking into Gradient Canopy, the sense of the future wraps around me once again. Cutting-edge architectural concepts, open and fluid spatial designs, and air filled with the aroma of coffee and the freshness of greenery. Under the massive dragon-scale dome, people come and go. Everyone walks in a hurry, yet their faces wear a strange hybrid expression—a mix of exhaustion from being chased by deadlines, and a heartfelt passion for what they are creating. No one is actually running, but everyone’s mind seems to be sprinting to catch the next singularity that will change the world. Appropriately, that Eagles song begins to play in my headphones, the melody spiraling upward. *Welcome to the Hotel California.*

Yes, welcome. This is Silicon Valley, a giant fortress under siege. The people outside are desperate to squeeze in, while the people inside, occasionally—just occasionally—gaze at the distant Diablo Range, contemplating the possibility of leaving. But you know in your heart you cannot truly leave. Just as the song goes: *you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.*

What is it that confines people here like gravity? Perhaps it is because the most cutting-edge technology and the simplest hedonism can run in parallel without contradiction: you can discuss the future of AGI in the morning, and drive to Half Moon Bay to surf in the afternoon. This extreme diversity is an allure in itself. But deeper down, perhaps it is that unmistakable atmosphere unique to this place: an eternal obsession that everything can be optimized. Everyone is optimizing their code, optimizing their investment portfolios, optimizing their fitness plans, and even optimizing their intimate relationships.

Sometimes I think this ceaseless optimization and pursuit might be the spiritual core of this country. After all, this is a nation built on immigrants. From the Puritans on the Mayflower to the Chinese laborers of the Gold Rush era, to the new immigrants clutching H1B visas while bitterly awaiting green cards today, it is essentially a gamble of leaving one’s home behind. It requires an idealism rooted in the blood, one that transcends food, clothing, shelter, and short-term gain—a courage to believe that "there must be something better afar," a resolve to wipe the past clean, abandon everything, and start anew. We are all moths drawn by the flame of this idealism.

And I, too, have been thoroughly reshaped within this grand narrative, inside this massive "hotel."

Growing up, I lived under the label of being "smart." People worship, or at least pretend to worship, cleverness and learning, but most view intelligence as a low-dimensional, easily quantifiable thing—believing it is logic, calculation, and the precise solution to clearly defined problems. I once thought so too, deeply convinced that the pursuit of this kind of intelligence should be paramount, arrogantly believing I had figured out the method to remain smart and thus admired. But life, that grandest of courses, gradually taught me that I am far less "smart" than I imagined.

The true realization and transformation perhaps began when I became a manager. When the black-and-white clarity of the coding world was replaced by the chaos and drama of the workplace; when I found myself time and again at the center of reorganizational turmoil and personnel storms, witnessing first-hand the complexity of human nature, the fragility of trust, and those puzzles that technology and logic can never crack—I sensed, for the first time, from my bosses and colleagues, a wisdom that algorithms cannot define. It was the ability to establish order within chaos, to seek consensus amidst contradiction.

The changes in my personal life were even more profound. I was once certain I would remain single for a long time, unable to imagine what binding a family with another person would look like, until I met my wife. Buying a house together, clumsily assembling IKEA furniture late at night, welcoming a kitten as a new family member... these grounded, irrational, yet incredibly real moments acted like a precision file, slowly smoothing away the hard, useless edges of my personality. They taught me how to rely and be relied upon, and made me understand that love itself is the highest form of wisdom.

Over the past two or three years, I have thrown myself into the AI wave. In day after day of study, I feel increasingly humble from the bottom of my heart—the more you know, the more vast the unknown becomes, and the more people you meet who leave you in the dust. On the other hand, just as AlphaGo defeating Lee Sedol did not extinguish humanity’s passion for Go, conversations with Gemini often make me feel that machine intelligence might, in a way we do not yet fully understand, reflect something back about ourselves.

I have begun to think about the topic of "intelligence" more broadly. I’ve come to feel that many crucial components of intelligence—those that sheer "smartness" cannot cover—actually point to the same core: whether you can adapt to environmental changes, find a way to converse with this complex world, and achieve your goals, rather than being trapped in your own biases and fixed mindsets.

I found some answers in books: *Liminal Thinking* and *Emotional Agility* taught me that simply changing your perspective on the same matter can yield entirely different conclusions; reading *Tiny Experiments*, I deeply resonated with the view that "setting goals directly doesn't always work." The Getting Things Done systems and the highly disciplined, organized habits I took pride in during my student days now seem so stretched and inadequate in the face of a complex and uncertain reality.

Looking back, many major decisions seem more like going with the flow in the torrent of fate. Before working, I thought I loved machine learning and would do it forever, but after facing setbacks in my first group at Google and switching teams at light speed, I happily left that pursuit behind; today, I am sharpening my spear to get back into the AI field. After receiving rejection letter after rejection letter, recalling the language modeling project I briefly did in a lab during undergrad, and that elective AI course with its long-outdated content, I can't help but feel a touch of karmic irony.

The reason for this, perhaps, is that I have always lived a sheltered, highly abstracted life. Before living independently, my identity as a good student allowed me to easily harvest a steady stream of praise and convenience, never knowing what frustration was. Even now, take the internal team transfer at Google as an example: though it is a major decision that should alter one's life trajectory, the process was simple to the point of unreality. You submit a resume on an internal system, click a few buttons, and a complex real-world problem is simplified into "Submission Successful" on a screen. You imagine that in some invisible distance, the gears of fate have begun to turn, yet you hear no sound of metal grinding.

The price of this sheltered life is the stagnation of growth. It allowed me to avoid the roughness and thorns of reality to deepen my professional knowledge and skills, but it also let me comfortably miss many of life's required courses. Consequently, I feel like a late student, constantly paying tuition for those subjects ignored or under-explored during my growth: the interpersonal interactions I always neglected, the intimacy I never experienced, and all those emotional experiences sacrificed in the pursuit of "hardcore intelligence." Now, like a language model that has just finished pre-training and only learned to predict the next word, I am learning to understand the ways of the world outside the rules, to handle the fragility and dependence within love and kinship, to admit my own biases and limitations, and to truly, clumsily... live.

Today, I can even say I have entered a fortress within a fortress—only a small fraction of colleagues working on AI can enter this Gradient Canopy building. But this time, within the fatalism of "never being able to leave," there seems to be a hint of willingness.

What will the next decade look like? The acceleration of the world’s changes is dizzying. I only know that I will still be here. But what comforts me is that, compared to that young hothead who made a fuss over an eighteen-dollar steak ten years ago, the me of today seems to possess a bit more wisdom and composure.

I take off my headphones and begin to work, but that classic guitar solo feels as if it never stopped; the final notes are stretched infinitely long, echoing repeatedly in the eternal California sunshine.
